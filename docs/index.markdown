I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, co-advised by [Chris RÃ©](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/) and [Kayvon Fatahalian](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/). My broad interests include machine learning and raytracing, and my recent work has focused on efficient model evaluation. Prior to my Ph.D, I received a B.S. in Computer Science at Stanford. In the past, I have worked with [Pat Hanrahan](https://profiles.stanford.edu/patrick-hanrahan) on metropolis light transport and path guiding, with [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/) on applications of GANs to satellite images, and with [Susan Athey](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/susan-athey) on the dynamics of Bitcoin usage.
