Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts on machine learning, research, and other topics that interest me.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover various topics including:

- **Machine Learning Research**: Updates on my work with LLM self-improvement and controllable diffusion models
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed explanations of interesting papers and techniques
- **Research Insights**: Lessons learned from my Ph.D. journey at Stanford
- **Industry Perspectives**: Thoughts on the current state and future of AI

## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by [Kayvon Fatahalian](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/). My research focuses on:

- **LLM Self-Improvement**: Developing agents that can improve their own capabilities
- **Controllable Diffusion Models**: Creating more controllable and interpretable image generation systems
- **Sequential Decision Making**: Building AI systems that can make complex decisions over time

## Recent Work

Some of my recent research includes:

- **Self-Generated In-Context Examples**: Improving LLM agents through self-generated examples
- **Automated Rewards**: Using LLMs to generate progress functions for reinforcement learning
- **Block and Detail**: Scaffolding sketch-to-image generation for better control

I'll be posting regularly (aiming for bi-weekly updates) and would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss any of these topics!
